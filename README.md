# AI-Powered-Urban-Heat-Island-Detection-for-Sustainable-City-Planning-Cottbus-
AI + Satellite Data to map Urban Heat Islands in Cottbus and guide climate-smart urban planning.
# 🌍 AI-Powered Urban Heat Island Detection – Cottbus, Germany

# 🚀 Project Title
**GeoAI for Urban Heat Risk Assessment in Cottbus (2023–2025)**

# 🧠 Project Overview

This rapid research project (10 hours) combines **Artificial Intelligence** and **Environmental Resource Management** to identify **Urban Heat Island (UHI)** risk zones in **Cottbus, Germany**. Using satellite imagery from 2023 and 2025, we applied a pretrained **U-Net** deep learning model to detect vegetation loss and climate vulnerability patterns.

> 🔗 Goal: Empower sustainable urban planning using AI-powered geospatial analysis.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Process

# Step 1: Preprocessing

- Resized satellite images for U-Net input
- Normalized and aligned image shapes
- Extracted NDVI-based vegetation contrast between years

# Step 2: AI Prediction using U-Net

- Used a pretrained U-Net model for semantic segmentation
- Output: `risk_mask.png` showing vegetation loss & UHI-prone zones

# Step 3: Environmental Analysis (Farhana's Work)

- Interpreted AI output to identify neighborhoods with high UHI risk
- Cross-checked low NDVI areas with real Cottbus map
- Assessed missing green infrastructure

# Step 4: Policy & Sustainability Mapping

- Proposed 5 localized interventions:
  - 🌿 Green roofs
  - 🌳 Urban street tree corridors
  - 🌼 Community gardens
  - 🧱 Permeable pavements
  - 🪴 Vertical gardens in dense areas
- Mapped these ideas to EU Green Deal and German Stadtentwicklungskonzept

**Insights:**
- Eastern districts show significant vegetation decline.
- Vulnerable zones coincide with high building density.
- Tree loss between 2023 and 2025 suggests urban sprawl without mitigation.
